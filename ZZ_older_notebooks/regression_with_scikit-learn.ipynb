It's modular interface and design make for rapid implementation and experimentation.  Plus, the documentation for `scikit-learn` is outstanding.\n",

    "The `scikit-learn` workflow outlined above (get data, create model object, fit model, inspect results) is basically the same across all of scikit-learn's many machine learning methods.  That consistency and ease of use is certainly one of the reasons `scikit-learn` is so popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should also note that the method we implemented above for polynomial regression, where we manually created the $hp^2$ column for our input dataframe, becomes rather cumbersome when we're dealing with large numbers of variables and we want to explore transformations of multiple variables or interactions.  As you might expect, `scikit-learn` implements tools to make this easier.  We won't cover the techniques right now, but the idea is to use data \"transformer\" objects to automatically create the extra dataframe columns.  You can [read more about that here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#polynomial-regression-extending-linear-models-with-basis-functions)."
