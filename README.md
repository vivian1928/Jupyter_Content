# Jupyter_Content

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for the AI in Biology class ([https://aibiology.github.io/](https://aibiology.github.io/)).

This class was initially developed and taught in the Spring of 2021 by Brian Stucky and Matt Gitzendanner.

Most notebooks have a student and teacher version. The teacher version has all the code filled in, while the student version is intended for use during class where students type in code.

Starting in Spring 2022, notebooks names are prepended with a number to help order them based on their use in the class. Unnumbered notebooks are not being used or have not been reviewed for inclusion. These unnumbered notebooks may start to fail as their code ages. All of the 2021 content is also available in the Spring 2021 branch of the repository.
